\chapter*{Abstract}

This initiative falls under the category of an integrative project in the Computer Engineering program at the  Facultad de Ciencias Exactas, FÃ­sicas y Naturales, driven by the IALAB laboratory.

The primary focus of this project is the development of a comprehensive management system that provides a web platform to streamline the allocation of cases to various committees. Each committee represents a subdivision of a subject, where a group of teachers, responsible for a subject, guide final-year students in the Law degree program at the Faculty of Law during their internships, providing this service free of charge to the community.

This system manages and organizes cases, essentially sponsored consultations, within each committee. Additionally, it simplifies control and supervision under the sponsorship leaders with administrative panels, user-friendly dashboards, alerts, and notifications. It also integrates Google Forms for the efficient registration of new clients and consultations.
