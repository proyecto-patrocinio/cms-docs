\chapter*{Abstract}

This project focuses on the development of a comprehensive management system that provides a web platform to streamline the assignment of cases to various committees and efficiently manage and organize these cases within each committee. Additionally, it includes an administrative panel designed to facilitate control and supervision by those responsible for sponsorship.

This service features real-time notifications and email sending capabilities. Furthermore, an integration with Google Forms has been implemented through the generation of plugins, providing an interface for the effective interconnection and management of the system. This integration enables the automation of client and query data loading into the system, thus optimizing workflow.
